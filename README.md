### TODO

- [ ] code refactoring
- [x] fix multiple selection state (previous behavior would prevent from noticing multiple selection of same color): an original code little logic bug would make hard to play if the same color is selected multiple times in a row (would not be easy to discern the sequence) is now (hopefully) fixed. Not sure if it is the optimal solution, but the removing of the `.selected` class should happen after the class is actually added.
